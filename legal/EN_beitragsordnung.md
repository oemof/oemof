The member is only entitled to membership rights for the period of time
for which the annual membership fee has been paid.

Members joining during the current year must
pay the full annual membership fee.

The membership fee may be reduced or waived by the executive board
upon application in the event of special circumstances. 

Each member is obliged to notify changes of address without delay.
